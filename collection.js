//   ðŸ‘‰ 3b. Use Node's default exporting syntax in collection.js to export the myCollection variable so that it's ready to import elsewhere in your folder. To use this new import/export syntax, we need to change our package.json so that it has the property "type": "module".

// Remember that you can check Google if you can't remember the syntax, but we are using ES6 import/export syntax!
